    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure Authorization Independence, support the required QAPs, and provide a clear and predictable data model for the Habitual application. It leverages path-based ownership and segregation for enhanced security and simplified security rules. The database structure is:\n\n`/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. Security rules will ensure that only the authenticated user can access their own profile data.\n\n`/users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}`: Stores habits owned by a specific user. This path-based ownership simplifies security rules, ensuring that only the user who owns the habit can access it.\n\n`/users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}/habitLogs/{habitLogId}`: Stores habit logs for a specific habit. This nested structure maintains the user-habit-habitLog relationship, ensuring clear ownership and simplifies access control.\n\nAuthorization Independence: The design enforces authorization independence by ensuring that each document's access control is determined solely by its path and the authenticated user's ID (`request.auth.uid`). There are no `get()` calls required to determine access, which maintains atomic operations and simplifies debugging.\n\nQAPs Support: The structure supports the required QAPs through:\n\n*   Segregation: Different data types (users, habits, habitLogs) are stored in separate collections, each with specific security requirements. This prevents mixing data with different access needs in the same collection.\n*   Path-Based Ownership: Access control is primarily based on the path (e.g., `/users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}`), making it straightforward to write security rules that enforce ownership.\n\nThis structure supports secure list operations because security rules can easily restrict access based on the `userId` present in the path, ensuring that users can only list habits and habitLogs that they own."
