/**
 * Habitual Security Rules
 *
 * CORE PHILOSOPHY:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict User-Ownership model. Access to data is determined
 * primarily by the document's location within the Firestore hierarchy, ensuring that
 * users can only access and modify data that belongs to them.
 *
 * DATA STRUCTURE:
 * The data is organized hierarchically starting from the user:
 * - /users/{userId}: The root profile for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}: Habits belonging to a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}/habitLogs/{habitLogId}: Logs associated with a specific habit.
 *
 * KEY SECURITY DECISIONS:
 * 1. Path-Based Authorization: By nesting habits and logs under the user's document, 
 *    we ensure that ownership is baked into the URL. This avoids expensive get() calls 
 *    in rules and simplifies the logic.
 * 2. Self-Creation: Users are permitted to create their own profile document 
 *    if the document ID matches their authenticated UID.
 * 3. Relational Integrity: On creation, we enforce that internal foreign keys 
 *    (like userId or habitId) match the path parameters to prevent data corruption.
 * 4. Immutability: Once a document is linked to a user or a habit via its path, 
 *    those relationship fields are made immutable to prevent data being "moved" 
 *    between users or habits via update.
 * 5. Prototyping Flexibility: These rules enforce WHO can access data but do not 
 *    enforce the specific schema (types/fields) of the content, allowing for rapid iteration.
